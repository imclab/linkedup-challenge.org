            <p><h3>There is a wealth of useful and inspirational material on the internet that can be used in education, ranging from lecture slides, tutorials, and online courses to Wikipedia articles and YouTube videos. But how could one find and connect the resources that learners need?</h3></p>
              
			<p><h3>The LinkedUp challenge is all about finding ways to link and mash up educational and cross-domain linked and open data to provide novel applications and services for open and distance education.</h3></p>
	
			<p><h3>There will be three consecutive competitions, and the first one will be launched on 11 March 2013. You can join in at each separate competition; participants to earlier competitions will be able to benefit from support and feedback from the LinkedUp team.</h3></p>
			<br />
            <ul><h3>
				<li><em>First competition:</em> Veni (March 2013 - October 2013): Innovative prototypes and tools for analysing and integrating open educational Web data</li>
				<li><em>Second competition:</em> Vidi (November 2013 - April 2014): Challenging and innovative, mature data-driven applications</li>
				<li><em>Third competition:</em> Vici (May 2014 - November 2014): Robust applications for large-scale educational use-cases, offered and provided by LinkedUp</li>
			 </h3></ul>	

			 <p><h3>To support the challenge, the LinkedUp support action has been collecting and cataloguing data explicitly related to education, ranging from open educational resources to course programmes and educational facilities. The <a href="http://datahub.io/group/linked-education" target="_blank">catalogue</a> is available now but will be further refined and extended. There is also a <a href="http://linkedu.eu/catalogue/" target="_blank">data endpoint</a>, associated with search and exploration services around this data.</p></h3>
	
			<p><h3>These data services are part of the complete environment that the LinkedUp prject will provide, including code samples, use case documentation, code clinics and developers' forum.</p></h3>

              <h1>Join the First Competition: Veni</h1>
			  <br/>
              <p><h3>The goal of the first LinkedUp competition is to gather innovative and robust prototypes for tools that analyse and/or integrate large scale, open web data for educational purposes. Submissions should demonstrate and promote the benefit of open web data technologies for education in the widest sense of the word.</h3></p>
			  <p><h3>The LinkedUp Veni Competition will be open for any kind of end-user application that analyses and/or makes use of Linked and/or Open Data for any kind of online learning.</h3></p>
			  <p><h3>Looking for inspiration? We collected a few sample, real-world use cases from the e-learning, industrial and edutainment fields. <a href="usecases.html">Check these out!</a></h3></p>

			  <h3><p>Important dates for the Veni Competition:
			  <ul>
			  <li>11 March 2013: Launch of the Challenge</li>
			  <li>13 May 2013: Final release of the comprehensive LinkedUp dataset</li>
			  <li>27 June 2013: Submission deadline</li>
			  <li>1 September 2013: Notifications and nominations</li>
			  <li>17 September 2013: Presentations and award ceremony</li>

              <h1>Why participate?</h1>
			  <br/>
              <p><h3>First of all, there are cash prizes. Out of a total prize budget of 39.500 EUR the Veni Competition offers:<br />
			  <br />
			  <ul>
			  <li>1st prize: 2.000 EUR</li>
			  <li>2nd and 3rd prize: 1.000 EUR each</li>
			  <li>5 Runner-up prizes with a total value of 1.000 EUR</li>
			  </ul></h3></p>
			  <p><h3>More importantly, there are the opportunities for networking and promoting your application to a wide audience:
			  <br />
			  <br />
			  <ul>
			  <li>Showcase your ideas and solutions to the key community of researchers and practitioners in the ecucational field. The competition committee consists of well-known people from industry and academia. The accepted submissions and demos will be widely disseminated. Last but not least the results will be presented at the OKF Festival.</li>
			  <li>Establish contact with a network of professional major organisations. Draw attention to your services, products, company or research activities with your submission by participating in the growing LinkedUp community.</li>
			  <li>Deploy and evaluate your applications in real-world settings. LinkedUp offers a set of challenging use cases from real world large organizations, and stakeholders from e-learning (Commonwealth of Learning), publishing (Elsevier) and edutainment (Jake Berger, BBC). Your submission could provide them with solutions that they need.</li>
			  <li>Work with a large amount of linked datasets, collected and provided by LinkedUp. The LinkedUp dataset provides a convenient starting point for exploring well-described educational and non-educational data on the Web.</li>
			  <li>Benefit from dedicated support and guidance offered by LinkedUp. We have a team of people who are eager to support you. We will provide 'cooking recipes' and other kinds of documentation. Contact us with specific questions. You can even submit your code for technical support.</li>
			  <li>Use the LinkedUp dataset for your experiments and publications. Apart from your submission to the competition, we encourage you to continue the work and to submit it to conferences and other events.</li>

              <br/>
              <p><h3><ul>
			    <li>Create a <strong>demo, prototype or application</strong> that analyses and/or makes use of linked data for any kind of online learning.</li>
				<li>In your application, you <strong>use data sets</strong> from the LinkedUp data respository and/or data from other sources.</li>
				<li>The demo should be available to the review panel. A publicly available demo or even open source code would be a plus, but is not required.</li>
				<li>Write an abstract of 200 words describing your application and its goals. This abstract that will be published on the LinkedUp website.</li>
				<li>Provide information about your application in several evaluation criteria, such as intended audience and the usability of your application. This will be asked on the submission form, which will be published 13 May 2013.</li>

               <h1>About linking open educational data</h1>
               <br/><br/>		
               <p><h3>Linked data principles and techniques are used successfully to expose and link datasets from a large variety of resources, covering government, media, life sciences and user-generated content. The cloud of linked data is rapidly growing. Still, there is much more potential for users and society to benefit from widespread access to openly available data.</h3></p>
			   <p><h3>Education is an area that is expected to benefit highly from linked data approaches. Many institutes offer Open Educational Resources (OER) online. Famous examples include <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm" target="_blank">MIT Open CourseWare</a> and the UK Open University's <a href="http://www.open.edu/openlearn/" target="_blank">OpenLearn</a>. Linked data makes it possible to connect the various offerings with one another and with general-purpose resources such as Wikipedia.</h3></p>
			   <p><h3>The field of Learning Analytics focuses on the use of intelligent data, learner-produced data and analysis models to discover information and social connections, and to predict and advise on learning. In the LinkedUp challenges we highly appreciate findings, aggregations, visualizations and other results that pave the way to novel tools that make use of open educational and general-purpose Web resources.</h3></p>
